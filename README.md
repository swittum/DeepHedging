# Deep Hedging Repository
This repository contains a deep neural network designed to optimise a hedging strategy with respect to a risk averting measure (expected shortfall). For usage instructions, check main.py, hedging.ipynb and instruments.ipynb. The core idea for this project stems from the pfhedge repository from pfnet-research. This project is supposed to be a re-implementation for educational purposes and aims to be more beginner friendly by decreasing the degree of abstraction from the original framework.
